Existing literature suggests that a major reason for household food waste is poor food management. This includes unawareness about available foods as well as inadequate meal planning.  One solution is to use a food expiry tracking app, which often has the additional features of recipe suggestions and shopping list generation. There is a lack of studies that investigate the effect of food recommendation on food waste reduction, in particular that of item-based ones rather than recipe-based ones. Thus, for this project an Flutter application was developed for food expiry tracking that also provides users with an item-based food schedule. By recommending which food items to use on each day, the goal is to help users plan their meals better so that they can reduce their domestic food waste.

Currently, the application is limited to only Android users. 

Note that the API developed for this application can be found at https://github.com/soumya225/food_waste_backend.
